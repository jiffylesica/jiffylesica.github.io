Hi, I’m Jiffy (though if you're coming here from my resume or a job application, my name is *technically* 'Griffin'). I'm an interdisciplinary thinker and builder with a background in Computer Science and Religion, shaped by two formative gap years of exploration before college. I’m deeply interested in the intersection of technology, ethics, and human experience, and I strive to bring both analytical rigor and a humanistic lens to everything I build.

I graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Middlebury College, where I explored topics ranging from ethical AI and fairness in machine learning to Christian mysticism and Islamic devotional labor. My research bridges code and culture, logic and narrative.

On the technical side, I’m experienced in full-stack development, machine learning, parallel computing, and evolutionary algorithms. My projects spanning UAV payload R&D, deep learning with PyTorch, and building out my own digital travel logging platform (Almost all of which you can navigate to from my homepage!). On the creative side, I’m a photographer, pianist, and am passionate about storytelling.

Collaboration and leadership are at the heart of my work. I was a varsity rower, leadership team member, and assistant coach for the Middlebury Crew Team - experiences that pushed me to learn to lead with humility, find synergy within team settings, and realize that the best way to make progress is together.

I’m always looking for ways to connect seemingly distant dots—to build tools, stories, and systems that reflect both precision and care.

Feel free to reach out!
