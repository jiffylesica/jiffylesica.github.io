# Devotional Labor and the Making of Islamic Selfhood: An Ethnography of Meryem

> *This paper explores the making of Islamic selfhood through the lens of devotional labor, tracing the everyday practices and evolving spirituality of Meryem, a Muslim woman living in Morocco. Through ethnographic conversations, the study reveals how Meryem’s religious life is not simply believed but actively made through ritual, material expression, and narrative. It examines how her relationship to Islamic practices—such as daily prayer, fasting during Ramadan, and the use of prayer beads—shifts from transactional obligation to transformative spiritual discipline. The paper also foregrounds the role of materiality in her faith, focusing on the intimate care she puts into styling her hijab and using a digital tasbih as devotional tools that bridge the sacred and the everyday. Drawing on theoretical insights from scholars such as Catherine Bell, Saba Mahmood, and Sally Promey, this study argues that religion is continuously shaped by embodied acts, aesthetic choices, and the stories believers tell about themselves. Central to this work is the claim that Meryem’s narrative itself becomes a sacred act—one that affirms, clarifies, and deepens her spiritual identity. By highlighting the dynamic interplay between ritual, materiality, and storytelling, this paper invites a view of religion as an active, creative, and deeply personal process of becoming.*
